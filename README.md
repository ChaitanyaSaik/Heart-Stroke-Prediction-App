# 🫀 Heart Stroke Prediction App

A web application built using **Streamlit** and **Machine Learning** to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on health-related input features. This app also provides detailed insights into the dataset, preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation metrics, and prediction results.

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-stroke-prediction-app.git
cd heart-stroke-prediction-app
```
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install dependencies

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
🏃‍♂️ Running the App Locally
```bash

streamlit run app.py
Make sure app.py contains the main Streamlit application logic.
```

📊 **Model Evaluation**
Each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC Score

Confusion Matrix

🛡️ **Note on Imbalanced Data**
This dataset is imbalanced (majority of patients did not have a stroke). Therefore, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is applied to balance the training data and improve model fairness.

✨ **Future Improvements**
Add feature importance visualizations

Allow CSV upload for batch prediction

Incorporate deep learning models (DNN, GNN)

Enable model comparison plots

Deploy using Docker or HuggingFace Spaces
